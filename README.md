## What I'm About

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that make a difference. 

My playground is speed. I aim for the fastest of everything that exists.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me learning a new framework or optimizing something that's "already fast enough" (spoiler: it's never fast enough). or otherwise you'll find me losing my sanity in valorant.

## Currently

- Building my [EventEmitter](https://github.com/avonrylew/events) which is super feature stacked and optimized for bun runtime btw (150M ops/sec emit hello im goated).
- Building [FastMap](https://github.com/avonrylew/fastmap) which aims to be more feature stacked than <code>Map()</code> for the daily developer while keeping speed its first priority.
